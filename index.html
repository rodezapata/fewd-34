    <h1><strong>Whales</strong></h1>
    <p> Wikipedia tells us this about <strong>whales</strong>
      <blockquote cite="http://">
        Whales, derived from Proto-Germanic word hw√¶l, are a widely distributed and diverse
        group of fully aquatic marine mammals. They comprise the extant families Cetotheriidae
        (whose only living member is the pygmy right whale), Balaenopteridae (the rorqual whales),
        Balaenidae (right whales), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and
        narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale),
        and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).There are 40 extant species of whales.

        <p> But I like whales because they are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Huge</li>
          <li>friendly</li>
          <li>can hold their breath for a long time</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Whale Anatomy </h2>
        <p> There are some key parts to a whale's anatomy that I think are interesting </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of
          the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth.</li>
          </li>
          <li>Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid; but a few, like the sperm whale,
            feed on large invertebrates, such as giant squid.</li>
        </ol>
